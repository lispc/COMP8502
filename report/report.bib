The service allows users to browse and download applications developed with the Android {SDK} and published through Google, as well as music, magazines, books, movies, and television programs. Users can also purchase hardware, such as Chromebooks, Google Nexus-branded mobile devices, Chromecasts, and accessories, through Google Play.[2]},

	title = {Automated Static Code Analysis for Classifying Android Applications Using Machine Learning},
	abstract = {In this paper we apply Machine Learning ({ML)} techniques on static features that are extracted from Android's application files for the classification of the files. Features are extracted from Android's Java byte-code (i.e.,.dex files) and other file types such as {XML-files.} Our evaluation focused on classifying two types of Android applications: tools and games. Successful differentiation between games and tools is expected to provide positive indication about the ability of such methods to learn and model Android benign applications and potentially detect malware files. The results of an evaluation, performed using a test collection comprising 2,285 Android .apk files, indicate that features, extracted statically from .apk files, coupled with {ML} classification algorithms can provide good indication about the nature of an Android application without running the application, and may assist in detecting malicious applications. This method can be used for rapid examination of Android .apks and informing of suspicious applications.},

	title = {Using static analysis for automatic assessment and mitigation of unwanted and malicious activities within Android applications},
	abstract = {In the last decade, smartphones have gained widespread usage. Since the advent of online application stores, hundreds of thousands of applications have become instantly available to millions of smart-phone users. Within the Android ecosystem, application security is governed by digital signatures and a list of coarse-grained permissions. However, this mechanism is not fine-grained enough to provide the user with a sufficient means of control of the applications' activities. Abuse of highly sensible private information such as phone numbers without users' notice is the result. We show that there is a high frequency of privacy leaks even among widely popular applications. Together with the fact that the majority of the users are not proficient in computer security, this presents a challenge to the engineers developing security solutions for the platform. Our contribution is twofold: first, we propose a service which is able to assess Android Market applications via static analysis and provide detailed, but readable reports to the user. Second, we describe a means to mitigate security and privacy threats by automated reverse-engineering and refactoring binary application packages according to the users' security preferences.},
